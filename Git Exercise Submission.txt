1. Installation 

- I installed it

2. Configuration 

- I set up my username and email


3. Initialization 

- I clicked file --> new repository and made a repository on my computer named GitAdventure

- I opened the folder on my computer, per the request of the assignment.


4. Staging and Committing

- I made a file named journey.txt with the phrase "Starting my Git journey" inside of it.
- I reopened GitHub Desktop and verified that journey.txt was staged and committed

5. Deletion:

- I made a file named temp.txt and put inside it "This file is meant to be deleted."
- I staged and committed this file
- I deleted the file on my computer and staged and committed the changes in GitHub Desktop.

6.) Renaming:
- I renamed journey.txt to adventure.txt and changed its contents.
- GitHub has recognized that journey.txt does not exist anymore and that adventure.txt does with the proper content inside of it.
- I staged and committed the changed


7.) Ignoring Files
- created a file named .gitignore with "*.log" inside to ignore .log files. I staged and committed it,
- I created a test.log file and GitHub Desktop successfully ignored it.

8.) Diving Deeper
- I updated the contents of adventure.txt.
- I saw the changes and staged and committed them.

9.) History and Restoration
- I viewed the history changes, played around and figured the best way to revert the change was to manually do it and recommit the new file. i just copy and pasted the old text into the document and staged/committed it.
